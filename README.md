# Robotics Software Engineer Technical Assessment

This assessment is about setting up a development environment, solving a core robotics math problem(least-squares solution of Ax = b with a random 3D transformation), and finally visualizing a robot model in RViz.

## Step 1: Development Environment with Docker

This step sets up a containerized development environment for ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill using Docker and Docker Compose:

Prerequisites

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

- [Install Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Install Docker Desktop on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

You may follow the instructions for your platform you are working with in case you dont have Docker/Docker Compose
, then return here to build and use the Container :) .
